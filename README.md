# 🎟️ Ticketflow

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.5.

## 🌟 Overview

**TicketFlowAI** is a web application that helps manage tech support tickets to streamline an IT department helpdesk environment. It is comprised of two parts, and this is the front end. TicketFlowAI connects to AWS AI services such as Comprehend and Bedrock to classify ticket priority, complexity, and the need for human interaction according to a model trained on custom data from each company. It can also provide automated answers for simple queries that don't need human interaction based on custom documentation from each company.

## 🚀 Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## 🛠️ Code scaffolding

## 🔍 Running end-to-end tests
